状态：`STAGE 4 COMPLETE — STATISTICAL EARLY STOP; NO STAGE 5 PHASE CLAIM`

## 当前目标

模型约定、恒正 oracle、`m=3,4` ED、DQMC/ED 交叉验证、双机粗图和
Stage 4 统计审计均已冻结。当前不释放 Stage 5 相声明；只有新的预注册采样器或
显著更高 ESS 的独立验证才能重新开启热力学扩展。

## 阶段

- [x] Stage 0：oracle、Hermiticity、正规序和数守恒
- [x] Stage 1：`m=3,4` ED 侦察
- [x] Stage 2：DQMC 与 ED 交叉验证
- [x] Stage 3：双机粗扫描
- [ ] Stage 4：幸存者密集扫描
- [ ] Stage 5：有限尺寸标度与独立检查
- [ ] Stage 6：论文包

## 下一步

1. Stage 4 第一优先：半填充核心带 `g_B/g_A=0.25,0.5,1`、`t/g_A=0.25,0.5,1`，包含 SURVIVE 和相邻低-ESS EXTEND。
2. 第二优先：`g_B/g_A≈1,t/g_A≈1,μ/g_A=±1.5` 的成对长链，验证通道换序与粒子-空穴一致性。
3. 增加统计量与一个更大尺寸，计算 susceptibility、Binder ratio 和相关长度 proxy；继续保留 `g_B=0`、`t=0` 控制但不扩展。

## Stage 4 round 0 — frozen production contract (2026-07-29)

- Stage 3 delivery was re-verified at `3322167`; the 675 fingerprinted coarse
  cells were not rerun.
- Frozen Stage 4 pilot grid: 90 cells (54 half-filled core and 36 matched
  `mu/g_A = +/-1.5` competition cells), two pilot replicas per cell.
- Frozen production rule: four new replicas, worst-observable tau-driven
  extension to ESS >= 40 per replica, with recoverable extension only up to the
  preregistered caps.
- New audited observables: exact Gaussian first-to-fourth channel moments,
  central-moment Binder ratios, contact-subtracted HS static susceptibility,
  staggered/neighbor structure factors, and an open-chain second-moment
  correlation-length proxy.
- Production cannot start from a self-asserted plan: it must revalidate all 180
  pilot summaries, exact seeds/configs/fingerprints/common source, full-summary
  digest, recomputed budgets, and equal matched-`mu` budgets.
- Independent code review found four Important issues in the first
  implementation; all were fixed. Final re-review: PASS, no remaining
  Critical/Important findings.
- Verification: `49 passed`; runner and pilot aggregator compile cleanly.
- Commits: `4b7a0bb`, `8037e4a`, `bd0bcb0`, pushed to
  `work/zibojin/tensor-square-phase-diagram`.
- No Stage 4 physics result has been inspected yet. Next action is a one-cell
  clean-commit smoke run, followed by the two-machine 180-replica pilot.

## Stage 4 rounds 1-3 — dense scan and m=10 judgement (2026-07-29)

Current status: `STAGE 4 STATISTICAL EARLY STOP — NO STAGE 5 PHASE CLAIM`

- Pilot completed 180/180 replicas with zero errors. Provenance and frozen
  budget validation released 44/90 cells; 46/90 stopped at the pilot
  autocorrelation budget gate.
- Production completed all 176 requested replicas: 95 passed ESS, 81 reached
  the frozen autocorrelation cap, and zero had worker/determinant errors.
- At the strict cell level, 15/44 released cells had all four replicas pass and
  29/44 had at least one early stop. Minimum passing ESS was 40.03, direct sign
  remained +1, and maximum log-weight error was 1.14e-13.
- Updated candidate ranking: `SURVIVE=0`, `EXTEND=0`, `STOP=21`. These are
  statistical-only stops caused by incomplete audited endpoint grids, not
  physical no-go statements.
- A single numerical-only `m=10, beta=4` sentinel was released at
  `(g_B/g_A,t/g_A,mu/g_A)=(0.25,0.5,0)`. Two of four replicas passed; two hit
  the autocorrelation cap. The passing subset has `Q=2.9168(90)` versus
  `m=8: 2.3603(42)`, while staggered structure and `xi/m` also increase.
- Because the complete four-replica m=10 audit failed and the required
  `beta=8` endpoints are censored, the first finite-size judgement is:
  **达到早停；当前信号按有限尺寸或普通 crossover 处理，不支持继续
  Stage 5 的相主张。**
- No m=12 expansion, literature novelty claim, or PRL package is released.
- Remote verification: 60 tests passed on the clean CPU sentinel commit
  `dc87c6c`; all numerical work, aggregation, and plotting ran on the approved
  WSL/CPU machines. The local Windows control host ran no numerical job.
- Artifacts: `results/stage4_20260729/`; scientific note:
  `notes/stage4_dense_results.md`.
- Code/result commits `3a3fce2`, `dc87c6c`, and `b1c2b88` were pushed to
  `work/zibojin/tensor-square-phase-diagram`; PR #178 was not modified.

## Stage 4 round 4 — autocorrelation root-cause audit (2026-07-29)

- The 81 production early stops were decomposed without rerunning any
  fingerprinted Stage 3 or Stage 4 point. Worst-observable counts are
  `hs_q_a=30`, `hs_q_b=18`, `q_a_sq=15`, `q_b_sq=10`,
  `staggered_structure=7`, and `q_combined=1`.
- The censoring is concentrated at low temperature: at `beta=8`, complete /
  early-stop replica counts are `10/34` for `m=4`, `0/16` for `m=6`, and
  `0/16` for `m=8`. At `beta=4` they are `26/10`, `36/0`, and `23/5`.
- This supports a sampler bottleneck in imaginary-time channel modes, not a
  sign or determinant-stability failure. A default-disabled full-imaginary-time
  channel pCN proposal was implemented with separate acceptance and
  checkpoint counters.
- The validation order, fixed scale `0.1`, paired seeds, budgets, 3-sigma ED
  gate, 2-sigma observable-consistency gate, and 25% tau-reduction gate were
  recorded before numerical evaluation in
  `notes/autocorrelation_mitigation_preregistration.md`.
- Remote-only verification is green: `62 passed`, including bitwise
  checkpoint/resume with the new proposal. The local Windows control host ran
  no numerical test or chain.
- Next action: run the frozen m=3 ED cross-validation from a clean commit. Only
  if it passes may the single censored `m=8,beta=8` A/B point run.

## Stage 4 round 5 — temporal-block sampler early stop (2026-07-29)

- Clean source `852a83a` was pushed before compute and re-verified with
  `66 passed` on WSL. The m=3 gate then ran eight independent chains with
  BLAS single-threaded; the Windows control host performed no numerical work.
- Numerical audits passed in both arms: direct sign `+1`, maximum log-weight
  error `5.04e-11`, healthy total acceptance, and temporal-block acceptance
  `0.909-0.918`.
- The local control agrees with ED, but the temporal-block energy is
  `-5.75972(159)` versus exact `-5.69171314`, a `4.285 sigma` deviation beyond
  the frozen `3 sigma` gate. Sampler-to-sampler energy differs by
  `2.861 sigma`, still inside its separate `3 sigma` consistency gate.
- Pre-registered decision: **STOP temporal-block updater**. The programmatic
  release gate therefore prevented the `m=8,beta=8` A/B run. No scale, seed,
  budget, or threshold was changed.
- Descriptively, median worst tau fell `21.1%`, short of the later `25%`
  advance threshold, while CPU seconds per effective sample rose `18.2%`.
- Artifacts:
  `results/stage4_20260729/autocorrelation_mitigation/m3_ed/`; scientific note:
  `notes/autocorrelation_mitigation_results.md`.
- Next action: freeze and validate a parameter-free full-channel reflection
  proposal as a distinct sampler candidate. It must pass the same ordered
  m=3 ED gate before any Stage 4 point is released.

## Stage 4 round 6 — channel-reflection contract (2026-07-29)

- A distinct parameter-free proposal was frozen:
  `phi_c(tau) -> -phi_c(tau)` for one complete channel history at a time.
  The Gaussian prior is invariant and the proposal is an involution, so only
  the determinant ratio enters the acceptance test.
- The failed fixed-scale temporal-block proposal is disabled. Local
  time-slice pCN updates remain active.
- The ordered m=3 ED and single censored m=8 A/B gates, paired seeds, budgets,
  acceptance/stability windows, 3-sigma / 2-sigma consistency gates and 25%
  tau threshold were recorded before compute in
  `notes/channel_reflection_preregistration.md`.
- The runner requires a same-revision m=3 PASS artifact and binds its digest
  into every Stage 4 chain fingerprint.
- Remote-only verification: `73 passed`, including a real spawned reflection
  worker; both runners and the DQMC kernel compile cleanly. No reflection
  physics chain has run yet.
- Next action: independent code review, clean commit/push, then the frozen
  eight-chain m=3 gate on WSL.

## Stage 4 round 7 — channel-reflection early stop (2026-07-29)

- Clean source `db0d114` passed `73` tests on both WSL and CPU machine.
- The m=3 ED gate passed decisively. Maximum ED displacement was
  `0.393 sigma`, maximum two-arm displacement was `0.545 sigma`, reflection
  acceptance was `0.136-0.153`, and all sign/stability gates passed.
- The same-revision PASS digest released exactly one
  `(m,beta,g_B/g_A,t/g_A,mu)=(8,8,0.25,0.5,0)` A/B on CPU machine, with two
  paired-seed replicas per arm and the frozen 240/640 budget.
- At m=8 all five observables agree between arms (maximum `0.992 sigma`), direct
  sign is `+1`, and maximum log-weight error is `1.71e-13`.
- Pre-registered decision: **STOP channel reflection**. One reflection replica
  has acceptance `0.0413<0.05`; median worst tau worsens by `8.77%` instead of
  improving by 25%; CPU seconds per effective sample increase by `81.7%`.
- Minimum fixed-budget ESS is only `4.98-5.83`, so this is an algorithm stop,
  not a physics no-go. No Stage 5 release, longer reflection run or broader
  reflection scan is authorized.
- Artifacts: `results/stage4_20260729/channel_reflection/`; scientific note:
  `notes/channel_reflection_results.md`.
- GitHub HTTPS was unavailable during this round. `db0d114` is committed in
  the D-drive branch and fixed clean clones; the personal-branch push remains
  pending and will be retried without changing credentials or remote target.
- Next action: stop adding ad hoc global proposals. Re-rank the remaining
  healthy beta=4 numerical sentinels and test the next pre-registered candidate
  with the original validated sampler, while treating beta=8 as censored.

## Channel-reflection round closeout at user budget boundary (2026-07-29)

- The user closed the current round after the independent review, mandatory
  m=3 ED gate and sole pre-registered m=8,beta=8 A/B. No new sampler, m=10,
  m=12, Stage 5 calculation or literature search is authorized in this
  session.
- Final numerical outcome is unchanged: m=3 **PASS**, m=8 A/B **STOP**, and
  Stage 5 is not released. This is an algorithm stop, not a physics no-go.
- Large/raw state and checkpoints remain off Git. Exact experiment ID, source
  revision, all 12 run fingerprints, retained remote directories and
  same-revision recovery commands are recorded in
  `notes/channel_reflection_closeout.md`.
- At `2026-07-29T17:23:44Z`, read-only process audits found zero relevant
  compute processes on both WSL and the CPU machine. Both retained numerical
  source trees were clean at `db0d114`.
- The WSL m=3 release artifact and its CPU recovery copy have identical
  SHA-256
  `572a663b7a2d17852c1a44995e535bb40cf98cf7d5c0e09cdaf559cd99fb2ec6`.
- The Windows control host performed no numerical calculation.
- GitHub connectivity recovered during closeout. The code, aggregate-result
  and closeout commits were pushed to
  `work/zibojin/tensor-square-phase-diagram`; the final branch SHA is verified
  externally after the last documentation commit and reported in the handoff.
- Sole next entry: pull the final closeout commit, verify remote source
  revisions, checkpoints, frozen fingerprints and release digest, and do not
  rerun any complete point.
